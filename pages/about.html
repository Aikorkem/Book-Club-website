                <p><strong>Languages and Genres</strong></p>
                <p>The club was founded in 14th June of 2020. In just 2 years more than 1000 people joined the club.
                    We read in 4 languages: English, Russian, Chinese and Spanish. In one year we read and discuss 24 books in 12 genres.
                    We read different genres every month in order to expand the horizons of readers and to introduce readers to new authors.
                    The genres we read are: Classical, Detective, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Dystopian, Graphic Novels and a lot more.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Book Selection</strong></p>
                <p>The genre to read is chosen by readers in the group chat. Then participants suggest books in chosen genre. 
                    The curator starts another vote to select books. After 24 hours 2 books with most votes are chosen, and the curator
                    sends an electronic version of the books to the group.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Online meetings</strong></p>
                <p>Online meetings for book reviews are held every 2 weeks on weekends (Saturday/Sunday). The duration of the debriefing meeting is 
                    on average 2-2.5 hours. The meeting time is selected once and remains fixed further. At the meeting each participant is given
                     10 minutes to debrief. After each participant has spoken, the group votes for the best analysis of the book. The winner at 
                     the meeting gets a gift from the book club.
